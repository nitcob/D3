1.	Ease to develop for developers [40 words]•	R – Medium It’s fairly easy to use the grammar of graphics is intuitive.•	Tableau –Easy It works directly out of the box. It is very intuitive since it uses a similar functionality as pivot tables in excel. •	D3 –Hard Versions vary greatly how you interact with the tool.2.	Ease to maintain the visualization for developers (e.g., difficulty of the maintenance of the product as the requirements change, the data changes, the hosting platform changes, etc.) [40 words]•	R – Medium is generally requires technical knowledge to be able to maintain.•	Tableau –Easy Maintenance is easy and intuitive.•	D3 – Hard Maintenance is hard since changes in the version will alter functions, objects and other properties. 3.	Usability of visualization developed for end users [40 words]•	R: -Strong Visualizations can be interactive, not as interactive as D3 but very close.•	Tableau: -Medium Visualizations are interactive but limited to what the software package offers.•	D3: - Strong Visualizations are interactive is very versatile and offers a wide range of tools to tell a story.4.	Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets [40 words]•	R – Can handle large datasets pretty easily it is the default tool for machine learning thus is very versatile.•	Tableau – Can handle large datasets however it cannot handle transformations and calculations of these since this is mainly a visualization tool.•	D3 – Can handle large datasets and calculations it is also very versatile in customization.5.	System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users [40 words]•	R – Basic R and if preferred R studio. For shiny R you need to install an extension.•	Tableau – Licensing for tableau desktop and tableau server for publishing. Licensing can be very expensive.•	D3 – Basic browser that supports JavaScript (Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.)  installing d3 and implementation of JSDOM.
